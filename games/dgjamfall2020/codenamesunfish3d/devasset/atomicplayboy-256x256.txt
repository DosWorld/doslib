This image has a 64-color palette, which is fine in combination with other
elements in the same game.

This is cropped and expanded to 256x256 from the original 320x200 artwork
taken from the Second Reality source code repo to match the way it appears
in the demo during the rotozoomer part. Note that conversion from LBM to
PPM to PNG was needed for Linux image manipulation tools to use it.
