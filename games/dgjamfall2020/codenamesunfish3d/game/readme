
To run the game, start the game in DOS
or DOSBox and run GAME.COM.

By design, you may also directly run
the mini-games, which are functional
stand-alone executables on their own.

Mini game #1: CRAPTN52.EXE
Mini game #2: MINGAME2.EXE
Mini game #3: MINGAME3.EXE

This game is a not-so-serious programming
experiment written in C and assembly
using NASM (Netwide Assembler) and
Open Watcom C. It uses libraries and
functions from the DOSLIB project for
VGA, sprite, Sound Blaster and Adlib
support, and image and compression
support.

Requirements:

Intel 386SX/8MHz or higher.
VGA video hardware.
440KB of conventional DOS memory.
PC/AT keyboard and keyboard controller.

Recommended DOS configuration:

Intel 386SX/20MHz or higher.
540KB of conventional DOS memory (does not use EMS/XMS... yet).
Sound Blaster Pro or higher.

For best compatibility with your DOS system
please set the BLASTER environment variable.
To do this, type on the command line OR add
to your AUTOEXEC.BAT:

   SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T3

   Where I<n> is the IRQ, D<n> is the DMA,
   and A<n> is the base I/O port of your
   Sound Blaster. This game does not use
   the T<n> value.

Some sound card installation utilities will
add this to your AUTOEXEC.BAT for you when
you install or configure your sound card.

DOSBox will automatically set the BLASTER
variable from your dosbox.conf.

If BLASTER is not set, the game will attempt
to auto-detect the card on port 220h and 240h,
which will only work if your card also uses
IRQ 5 or 7 and DMA 1 (classic Sound Blaster
configuration).
