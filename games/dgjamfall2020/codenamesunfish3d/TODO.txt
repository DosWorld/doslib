- Game character walking/movement during dialogue
- "Oh come on! That's just mean" make pouting disgusted version of game
  sprite.
- Make your own damn sprites. Ripping off Final Finatasy sprites is fine
  for game dev and TESTING but in the end you need to make your own!
- Dialog/cutscene array needs a "clear entire canvas" command.
- Put VRL command needs a variant that can place something (i.e. the mouth)
  relative to another VRL already on canvas so mouth animation is easier.
