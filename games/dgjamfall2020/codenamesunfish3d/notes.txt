Game starts. Game characters and NPC alike arrive to the game developer to
hear the story of the game.

Game dev with shiny demo effects around him:
"I am the coolest programmer ever! I write the most optimized and
clever code!"

Game character: "But... what about us? What is the story of this game?"

Game dev, blank background: "Uhmm.........." (demo fx reappear) "I WRITE
THE MOST OPTIMIZED, THE MOST MODULAR AND AWESOME CODE! MY CODE IS UNMATCHED
IN PORTABILITY AND FUNCTION! I--"

(game cuts to game character leaving the room, closing the door)

Game character: *sigh* "Alright, there is no story. So I'll just make one up
to get things started" *ahem* "There once was a master programmer with
incredible programming skills. But he also had an incredible ego and was an
incredible perfectionist. So he spent his life writing incredibly optimized
and clever useless code. Then one day he ate too many nachos and had a heart
attack. The end."

Character in the crowd: "Oh, come on, that's just mean."

Game character: "Okay... okay... fine. And so he spent his life writing
incredible useless code. He created whole OSes but cared not for the users
who would run it. He created whole game worlds but cared not for the inhabitants.
So he lives to this day making... well, nothing of significance."

Game character: "Since the creator of this game doesn't seem to care about us, or
the story, we're all on our own. So let's go make our own mini games so that
we can salvage this game's playability and make it somewhat entertaining, at
least. I made a 3D maze-like overworld that connects them together so that
the poor user playing this game can get around. Alright, let's start!"

--------------------

"Craption 52" mini game (by Mr. Wooo Sorcerer himself)

- An obvious ripoff of Action 52
- Intro screen will use a loop of the "Whoo! Yeah!" from the NES cartridge and
  the "make your selection now" clip.
- Title screen will be deliberately made to look like a Microsoft Paint
  abomination (meaning the rudimentary paint program seen in Windows 3.1
  through XP) with some fancy font used to type the title. Mr. Woo sorcerer
  will be drawn as if by some nerd who thinks of himself as a powerful
  wizard or something (glowy eyes, lightning from hands, staff of power, etc.)
- Jokes about woo: "Stereo Sound" and "Expanded Continuous Sound" (this being
  a reference to some Windows 3.1 games seen on Shovelware Diggers). The
  credit screen could have that ever-classic over-used 90s Photoshop "Lens
  flare" effect on it (wonder why nobody uses that one anymore, hm?)
- Like Action 52, it will be made of shitty art resources as 2D topdown
  shooter or tank games that are obvious copy paste versions of each other
  and (intentionally made) glitches.

--------------------

Intended runtime environment: 16-bit real mode DOS. With support for
EMM386.EXE and HIMEM.SYS for some extra storage (but don't get carried away
like Project 16). Each mini-game could run as a separate executable that
talks to the main game executable (for memory reasons) and use their own
video mode and routines or the parent game EXE's video code.

EGA/VGA graphics, of course. 16-color, 256-color. Maybe even something
that uses VESA BIOS extensions to get SVGA 256-color modes. Maybe CGA.
The game will require VGA though.

386 or higher. 540K conventional memory minimum, to allow it to run on a
typical DOS setup.

Could later versions of the game pack the sub-EXEs into the game EXE and
run them from within, "Second Reality" style with INT 21h interception to
present the EXE contents as if a local filesystem? Obviously not in time
for the game jam, of course.

Sound Blaster and Adlib support, of course!

Overworld 3D engine will of course use Wolf3D style raycasting, because
that is easy to code.
